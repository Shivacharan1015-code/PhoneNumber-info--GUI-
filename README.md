# PhoneNumber-info--GUI-

This is a simple code, which lets you enter a phone number and it returns the some basic info about such as 'country' , 'location' , 'carrier'

In order to the run the program you need to have `requests` library, if you dont have this library installed run the following commands in your 
terminal/shell 
`pip3 install requests`

You need to get a free/paid API key from https://numverify.com and paste that on **LINE 12**

***Note: If you get a free API key, then you can make only 250 requests per month, so avoid using 'search all data'*** 

and then simply cd into the directory and run the program, like you would any python program.

This is a GUI based program.
